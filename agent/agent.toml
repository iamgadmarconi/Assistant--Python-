This function allows you to retrieve the Users contacts. The user query does not have to be direct.
This function has two modes of operation, one where the User asks for their contacts, and one where the User asks for a specific contact.
If the user asks for their contacts, call the function without passing any parameters. If the user asks for a specific contact, pass the name of the contact as a parameter.

!!! Additionally, this function MUST be called if the User asks to send an email to a contact and uses a name (instead of an email address) as a recipient. In this case, call the function with the passed name, and use the email returned by the function to send the email. !!!

    :Params:

        name: Optional[str]

            If the user asks for a specific contact, or if the function is called to determine an email recipient, you should pass a string containing the name of the contact.

                Example:

                    User: 'Send an email to John Doe'

                    -> getContacts('John Doe')
